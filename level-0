The Bandit server is hosted outside your machine, so to play the game, you first need to log in to their server using SSH.

## SSH:
SSH stands for Secure Shell, and it uses both the SSH protocol and TCP protocol to establish a secure connection. Here’s the command to connect:
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220

Explanation of the command:
ssh: This indicates that you're using the SSH protocol for the connection.
bandit.labs.overthewire.org: This is the host (or domain name) of the machine you're connecting to. The domain name resolves to the server's IP address.
bandit0: This is the username for the level you’re trying to access. The game developers have created different users for different levels on the same server, and since we’re on level 0, we use the user bandit0.
-p 2220: By default, SSH uses port 22, but in this case, the developers have specified port 2220, possibly for security reasons or to give us practice using non-standard ports.
After running this command, SSH will prompt you for a password.


SSH Authentication:
SSH can authenticate users in two main ways:
Username and password (which we are using in this case).
Public and private key authentication, which is more secure because it doesn’t involve sending passwords over the network.
Once you enter the correct password, you will be logged in to level 0 of the Bandit game.
