Bandit server is outside of your machine so the game first asks you to login to there server and for this it uses ssh.
SSH- 
   ssh stands for secure shell connection it uses ssh and tcp protocol for secure connection.
command-- ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
    explaination of command- ssh means you are using ssh for connection but connection to where(in which machine) and for this "bandit.labs.overthewire.org"
    . This is the host means machine name and but in a machine there could be multiple users so the game developers creates
    different users for different levels on the same server. so because we are on 0 level we will use bandit0 user.
    Now last part is port so in which you want to access the level0 and for this developers select port 2220 but important 
    thing is that ssh bydefault uses port 22 rather than that they uses port 2220, I don't know why may be security concern
    or they want us to use different port number for out practice
After running this command ssh will ask for password
        SSH is used in two different ways first- user name and password (which is in this case we are using)
        or other way is to use public and private key which is more secure.
So after submitting the password you will be able to login to level0.
