In Level 0, the password is stored in the README file. You can use the following commands to retrieve it:

ls: Lists all files and folders in the current directory (excluding hidden files and folders).
cat: Reads the content of the specified file, which will provide you with the password.
Once you have the password for Level 0, you can log in to Level 1. However, if you exit the game after reaching Level 1 and return later, you'll need to clear Level 0 again to proceed.

To avoid this repetition, you can store the password in a file for future use. Hereâ€™s how:

 1. Create a folder.
 2. Inside that folder, use the following command to store the password:

    echo "your_password" > 0
1. The echo command will output the text (in this case, the password).
2. The > symbol is used to redirect the output and create a file named 0 that stores the password.
